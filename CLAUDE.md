# nx-gir notes for Claude

## Code style

- Max line width is 60 characters in all code
  (Python, shell, config). The code is read on a phone.
- Configured in `pyproject.toml` (ruff) and
  `.editorconfig`.
- Before committing, run:

  ```sh
  ruff format scripts/ tests/
  ruff check scripts/ tests/
  python3 -m pytest
  ```

- `ruff format` cannot split long strings, comments or
  docstrings; shorten or wrap those by hand.
- Text files in `data/` and `grabar/` are content, not
  code, and are exempt.

## Layout

- `scripts/nxgir-cli.py`: commands and the `nxgir>` shell
- `scripts/nxgir_browse.py`: `bookshelf`, a folder
  view of `books/` and `data/` (curses); folder logic
  is tested in `tests/test_browse.py`
- `scripts/nxgir_reader.py`: the reader; text model at
  the top (tested in `tests/`), curses screen below
- `scripts/nxgir_state.py`: saved positions,
  bookmarks and settings (JSON in
  `~/.local/state/nxgir/`; tests use `NXGIR_STATE`)
- `scripts/nxgir_ui.py`: shared curses helpers; read
  keys with `key()`, it handles terminal resizes
- `scripts/nxgir_grabar.py`: Grabar helpers
  (`nxgir grabar abbr`); the data is in `grabar/`
  (`abbreviations.tsv` names its sources in the
  header; add only entries from a source)
- `scripts/nxgir_logo.py`: logos and gradient colors
- `scripts/fetch-bible.py`: downloads a book of the
  1895 Grabar Bible into `books/` (see
  `books/SOURCES.md`)
- `books/`: the library; `data/`: test texts
- `scripts/render-logo.py`, `scripts/render-screens.py`:
  regenerate the README images in `docs/` after
  changing the logo or the screens
- Linux and Termux only, no Windows support for now.
